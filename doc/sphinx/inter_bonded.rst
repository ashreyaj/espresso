.. _Bonded interactions:

Bonded interactions
===================

Bonded interactions are configured by the 
:class:`espressomd.interactions.BondedInteractions` class, which is
a member of :class:`espressomd.system.System`. Generally, one may use 
the following syntax to activate and assign a bonded interaction::

    system.bonded_inter.add(bond)
    system.part[pid1].add_bond((bond, pid2...))

In general, one instantiates an interaction object *bond* and subsequently passes it 
to :meth:`espressomd.interactions.BondedInteractions.add`. This will enable the
bonded interaction and allows the user to assign bonds between particle ids *pidX*. 
Bonded interactions are identified by either their *bondid* or their appropriate object.

Defining a bond between two particles always involves three steps:
defining the interaction, adding it to the system and applying it to the particles.
To illustrate this, assume that three particles with ids 42, 43 and 12 already exist.
One could for example create FENE bonds (more information about the FENE bond
is provided in subsection :ref:`FENE bond`) between them using::

    fene = FeneBond(k=1, d_r_max=1)
    system.bonded_inter.add(fene)
    system.part[42].add_bond((fene, 43), (fene, 12))
    system.part[12].add_bond((fene, 43))

This will set up a FENE bond between particles 42 and 43, 42 and 12, and 12 and 43.
Note that the *fene* object specifies the type of bond and its parameters,
the specific bonds are stored within the particles. you can find more 
information regarding particle properties in :ref:`Setting up particles`.

.. _Distance dependent bonds:

Distance dependent bonds
------------------------

.. _FENE bond:

FENE bond
~~~~~~~~~

A FENE (finite extension nonlinear elastic) bond can be instantiated via
:class:`espressomd.interactions.FeneBond`::
    
    from espressomd.interactions import FeneBond
    fene = FeneBond(k = <float>, d_r_max = <float>, r_0 = <float>)

This command creates a bond type identifier with a FENE
interaction. The FENE potential

.. math::

   V(r) = -\frac{1}{2} K \Delta r_\mathrm{max}^2\ln \left[ 1 - \left(
         \frac{r-r_0}{\Delta r_\mathrm{max}} \right)^2 \right]

models a rubber-band-like, symmetric interaction between two particles with magnitude 
:math:`K`, maximal stretching length :math:`\Delta r_0` and equilibrium bond length
:math:`r_0`. The bond potential diverges at a particle distance
:math:`r=r_0-\Delta r_\mathrm{max}` and :math:`r=r_0+\Delta r_\mathrm{max}`.

.. _Harmonic bond:

Harmonic bond
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A harmonic bond can be instantiated via
:class:`espressomd.interactions.HarmonicBond`::
    
    from espressomd.interactions import HarmonicBond
    hb = HarmonicBond(k = <float>, r_0 = <float>, r_cut = <float>)


This creates a bond type identifier with a classical harmonic
potential. It is a symmetric interaction between two particles. With the 
equilibrium length :math:`r_0` and the magnitude :math:`k`. It is given by

.. math:: V(r) = \frac{1}{2} k \left( r - r_0 \right)^2

The third, optional parameter defines a cutoff radius. Whenever a
harmonic bond gets longer than :math:`r_\mathrm{cut}`, the bond will be reported as broken,
and a background error will be raised.

.. _Harmonic Dumbbell Bond:

Harmonic Dumbbell Bond
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    Requires ROTATION feature.


A harmonic bond can be instantiated via
:class:`espressomd.interactions.HarmonicDumbbellBond`::
    
    from espressomd.interactions import HarmonicDumbbellBond
    hdb = HarmonicDumbbellBond(k1 = <float>, k2 = <float>, r_0 = <float>, r_cut = <float>)


This bond is similar to the normal harmonic bond in such a way that it
sets up a harmonic potential, i.e. a spring, between the two particles.
Additionally the orientation of the first particle in the bond will be aligned along
the distance vector between both particles. This alignment can be
controlled by the second harmonic constant :math:`k2`. Keep in mind that orientation will
oscillate around the distance vector and some kind of
friction needs to be present for it to relax.

The roles of the parameters :math:`k1, r_0, r_\mathrm{cut}` are exactly the same as for the
harmonic bond.

.. _Quartic bond:

Quartic bond
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo::
    Not implemented.


inter quartic

This creates a bond type with identificator with a quartic potential.
The potential is minimal at particle distance :math:`r=R`. It is given
by

.. math:: V(r) = \frac{1}{2} K_0 \left( r - R \right)^2 + \frac{1}{4} K_1 \left( r - R \right)^4

The fourth, optional, parameter defines a cutoff radius. Whenever a
quartic bond gets longer than , the bond will be reported as broken, and
a background error will be raised.

.. _Bonded coulomb:

Bonded coulomb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo::
    Not implemented.

inter bonded_coulomb

This creates a bond type with identificator with a coulomb pair
potential. It is given by

.. math:: V(r) = \frac{\alpha q_1 q_2}{r},

where and are the charges of the bound particles. There is no cutoff,
the Bjerrum length of other coulomb interactions is not taken into
account.

.. _Subtracted Lennard-Jones bond:

Subtracted Lennard-Jones bond
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo::
    Not implemented.

inter subt_lj

This creates a "bond‚Äù type with identificator , which acts between two
particles and actually subtracts the Lennard-Jones interaction between
the involved particles. The first parameter, is a dummy just kept for
compatibility reasons. The second parameter, , is used as a check: if
any bond length in the system exceeds this value, the program
terminates. When using this interaction, it is worthwhile to consider
capping the Lennard-Jones potential appropriately so that round-off
errors can be avoided.

This interaction is useful when using other bond potentials which
already include the short-ranged repulsion. This often the case for
force fields or in general tabulated potentials.

.. _Rigid bonds:

Rigid bonds
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    required BOND_CONSTRAINT feature.


A rigid bond can be instantiated via
:class:`espressomd.interactions.RigidBond`::
    
    from espressomd.interactions import RigidBond
    rig = RigidBond(r = <float>, ptol = <float>, vtol = <float> )

To simulate rigid bonds, |es| uses the Rattle Shake algorithm which satisfies
internal constraints for molecular models with internal constraints,
using Lagrange multipliers.:cite:`andersen83a` The constrained bond distance 
is named :math:`r`, the positional tolerance is named :math:`ptol` and the velocity tolerance
is named :math:`vtol`.

.. _Tabulated bond interactions:

Tabulated bond interactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    
    required TABULATED feature.


A tabulated bond can be instantiated via
:class:`espressomd.interactions.Tabulated`::
    
    from espressomd.interactions import Tabulated
    tab = Tabulated(type = <str>, min = <min>, max = <max>,
                    energy = <energy>, force = <force>)

This creates a bond type identifier with a two-body bond length, 
three-body angle or four-body dihedral 
tabulated potential. For details of the interpolation, see :ref:`Tabulated interaction`.

The bonded interaction can be based on a distance, a bond angle or a
dihedral angle. This is determined by the ``type`` argument, which can
be one of the strings ``distance``, ``angle`` or ``dihedral``.

.. _Calculation of the force and energy:

Calculation of the force and energy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The potential is calculated as follows:

-  ``type="distance"``: is a two body interaction
   depending on the distance of two particles. The force acts in the
   direction of the connecting vector between the particles. The bond
   breaks above the tabulated range, but for distances smaller than the
   tabulated range, a linear extrapolation based on the first two
   tabulated force values is used.

-  ``type="angle"``: is a three-body angle
   interaction similar to the bond angle potential.
   It is assumed that the potential is tabulated
   for all angles between 0 and :math:`\pi`, where 0 corresponds to a
   stretched polymer, and just as for the tabulated pair potential, the
   forces are scaled with the inverse length of the connecting vectors.
   The force on the extremities acts perpendicular 
   to the connecting vector
   between the corresponding particle and the center particle, in the plane
   defined by the three particles. The force on the center particle
   :math:`p_2` balances the other two forces.

-  ``type="dihedral"``: tabulates a torsional
   dihedral angle potential. It is assumed
   that the potential is tabulated for all angles between 0 and
   :math:`2\pi`. *This potential is not tested yet! Use on own risk, and
   please report your findings and eventually necessary fixes.*

.. _Virtual bonds:

Virtual bonds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A virtual bond can be instantiated via
:class:`espressomd.interactions.Virtual`::
    
    from espressomd.interactions import Virtual
    tab = Virtual()


This creates a virtual bond type identifier for a pair bond
without associated potential or force. It can be used to specify topologies
and for some analysis that rely on bonds, or for bonds that should be
displayed in the visualization.

.. _Bond-angle interactions:

Bond-angle interactions
-----------------------
.. note::
    `Feature BOND_ANGLE required.`

Bond-angle interactions involve three particles forming the angle :math:`\phi`, as shown in the schematic below.

.. _inter_angle:
.. figure:: figures/inter_angle.png
   :alt: Bond-angle interactions
   :align: center
   :height: 12.00cm

This allows for a bond type having an angle dependent potential.
This potential is defined between three particles.
The particle for which the bond is created, is the central particle, and the
angle :math:`\phi` between the vectors from this particle to the two
others determines the interaction.

Similar to other bonded interactions, these are defined for every particle triad and and must be added to a particle (see :attr:`espressomd.particle_data.ParticleHandle.bonds`).
For example, for the schematic with particles ``id=0``, ``1`` and ``2`` the bond was defined using ::

    >>> system.part[1].add_bond((bond_angle, 0, 2))

The parameter ``bond_angle`` is a bond type identifier of three possible bond-angle classes, described below.


:class:`espressomd.interactions.AngleHarmonic`
    A classical harmonic potential of the form: 
    
    .. math:: V(\phi) = \frac{K}{2} \left(\phi - \phi_0\right)^2.

    :math:`K` is the bending constant,
    and the optional parameter :math:`\phi_0` is the equilibirum bond angle in
    radians ranging from 0 to :math:`\pi`.

    If this parameter is not given, it defaults to :math:`\phi_0 = \pi`,
    which corresponds to a stretched conformation.

    Unlike the two other variants, this potential has a kink at
    :math:`\phi=\phi_0+\pi` and accordingly a discontinuity in the
    force, and should therefore be used with caution.

    example ::
        >>> angle_harmonic=AngleHarmonic(bend=1.0, phi0=np.pi)
        >>> system.bonded_inter.add(angle_harmonic)
        >>> system.part[1].add_bond((angle_harmonic, 0, 2))



:class:`espressomd.interactions.AngleCosine`

    Cosine bond angle potential of the form:

    .. math:: V(\phi) = K \left[1 - \cos(\phi - \phi0)\right]

    :math:`K` is the bending constant,
    and the optional parameter :math:`\phi_0` is the equilibirum bond angle in
    radians ranging from 0 to :math:`\pi`.

    If this parameter is not given, it defaults to :math:`\phi_0 = \pi`,
    which corresponds to a stretched conformation.

    Around :math:`\phi_0`, this potential is close to a harmonic one
    (both are :math:`1/2(\phi-\phi_0)^2` in leading order), but it is
    periodic and smooth for all angles :math:`\phi`.

    example ::
        >>> angle_cosine=AngleCosine(bend=1.0, phi0=np.pi)
        >>> system.bonded_inter.add(angle_cosine)
        >>> system.part[1].add_bond((angle_cosine, 0, 2))

:class:`espressomd.interactions.AngleCossquare`

    Cosine square bond angle potential of the form:

    .. math:: V(\phi) = \frac{K}{2} \left[\cos(\phi) - \cos(\phi_0)\right]^2

    This form is used for example in the GROMOS96 force field. The
    potential is :math:`1/8(\phi-\phi_0)^4` around :math:`\phi_0`, and
    therefore much flatter than the two potentials before.

    example ::
        >>> angle_cossquare=AngleCossquare(bend=1.0, phi0=np.pi)
        >>> system.bonded_inter.add(angle_cossquare)
        >>> system.part[1].add_bond((angle_cossquare, 0, 2))


.. _Dihedral interactions:

Dihedral interactions
---------------------

Dihedral interactions are available through the :class:`espressomd.interactions.Dihedral` class.

This creates a bond type with identificator with a dihedral potential, a
four-body-potential. In the following, let the particle for which the
bond is created be particle :math:`p_2`, and the other bond partners
:math:`p_1`, :math:`p_3`, :math:`p_4`, in this order. Then, the
dihedral potential is given by

.. math:: V(\phi) = K\left[1 - \cos(n\phi - p)\right],

where :math:`n` is the multiplicity of the potential (number of minima) and can
take any integer value (typically from 1 to 6), :math:`p` is a phase
parameter and :math:`K` is the bending constant of the potential. :math:`\phi` is
the dihedral angle between the particles defined by the particle
quadrupel :math:`p_1`, :math:`p_2`, :math:`p_3` and :math:`p_4`, the
angle between the planes defined by the particle triples :math:`p_1`,
:math:`p_2` and :math:`p_3` and :math:`p_2`, :math:`p_3` and
:math:`p_4`:

|image_dihedral|

Together with appropriate Lennard-Jones interactions, this potential can
mimic a large number of atomic torsion potentials.

.. _Drude bond:

Drude bond
----------

.. note::

    Requires features DRUDE, THOLE, ELECTROSTATICS, LANGEVIN_PER_PARTICLE.

.. note::

    DRUDE is only implemented for the P3M electrostatics solver and the Langevin thermostat.

This bond implements **thermalized cold drude oszillators** and can be used to
simulate polarizable particles.  The basic idea is to add a
'charge-on-a-spring' (Drude charge) to a particle (Drude core) that mimics an
electron cloud which can be elongated to create a dynamically inducible dipole.
The energetic minimum of the Drude charge can be obtained self-consistently,
which requires several iterations of the system's electrostatics and is usually
considered computational expensive. However, with thermalized cold Drude
oszillators, the distance between Drude charge and core is coupled to a
thermostat so that it fluctuates around the SCF solution. This thermostat is
kept at a low temperature compared to the global temperature to minimize the
heat flow into the system. A second thermostat is applied on the centre of mass
of the Drude charge + core system to maintain the global temperature. The
downside of this approach is that usually a smaller time step has to be used to
resolve the high frequency oscillations of the spring to get a stable system.

In |es|, the *Drude bond* takes care of the harmonic bond and the 
thermalization of the Drude complex. The system-wide thermostat has to be
applied to the centre of mass and not to the core particle directly. Therefore,
the particles have to be excluded from global thermostating.  With
``LANGEVIN_PER_PARTICLE`` enabled, we set the temperature and friction
coefficient of the Drude complex to zero, which allows to still use a global
Langevin thermostat for non-polarizable particles. Additionally, the
short-range electrostatic interaction between Drude charge and core is
subtracted by the *Drude bond*.

A Drude bond is configured with::

    from espressomd.interactions import DrudeBond
    drude_bond = DrudeBond(temp_com = <float>, gamma_com = <float>, temp_drude = <float>, gamma_drude = <float>, k = <float>, r_cut = <float>)
    system.bonded_inter.add(drude_bond)

The parameters are:

    * temp_com : Temerature of the Langevin thermostat for the COM of the core-drude pair.
    * gamma_com: Friction coefficient of the Langevin thermostat for the COM of the core-drude pair.
    * temp_drude: Temerature of the Langevin thermostat for the distance vector of the core-drude pair.
    * gamma_drude: Friction coefficient of the Langevin thermostat for the distance vector of the core-drude pair.
    * k: Spring constant of the harmonic bond between core and drude charge.
    * r_cut:  Specifies maximum distance beyond which the bond is considered broken.

As the Drude charge should not alter the *charge* or *mass* of the Drude
complex, both properties have to be subtracted from the core when adding the
drude particle. In the following convention, we assume that the Drude charge is
**always negative**. It is calculated via the spring constant :math:`k` and
polarizability :math:`\alpha` (in units of inverse volume) with :math:`q_d =
-\sqrt{k \cdot \alpha}`.

The following helper method takes into account all the preceding considerations
and can be used to convenientely add a drude particle to a given core
particle::

    from drude_functions import *
    add_drude_particle_to_core(<system>, <core particle>, <drude bond>, <id drude>, <type drude>, <alpha>, <mass drude>, <coulomb_prefactor>, <thole damping>, <verbose>)

The arguments of the helper function are:
    * <system>: The espressomd.System().
    * <core particle>: The core particle on which the drude particle is added.
    * <drude bond>: The drude bond, usually a single drude bond type can be
      used for all core-drude pairs if the parameters don't change.
    * <id drude>: The user-defined id of the drude particle that is created.
    * <type drude>: The user-defined type of the drude particle. If the Thole
      correction is used, the Drude particles of each complex should have an
      individual type (e.g. in an ionic system with Anions (type 0) and Cations
      (type 1), Drude types should be 2 and 3).
    * <alpha>: The polarizability volume.
    * <coulomb_prefactor>: The coulomb prefactor of the system. Used to
      calculate the drude charge from the polarizability and the spring constant
      of the drude bond.  
    * <thole damping>: (optional) An individual thole damping parameter for the
      core-drude pair. Only relevant if thole damping is used (defaults to 2.6).
    * <verbose>: (bool, optional) Prints out information about the added Drude
      particles (default: False)

.. _Canceling intramolecular electrostatics:

Canceling intramolecular electrostatics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that for polarizable molecules (i.e. connected particles, coarse grained
models etc.) with partial charges on the molecule sites, the drude charges will
have electrostatic interaction with other cores of the molecule.  Often, this
is unwanted, as it might be already part of the force-field (via. partial
charges or parametrization of the covalent bonds). Without any further
measures, the elongation of the drude particles will be greatly affected be the
close-by partial charges of the molecule. To prevent this, one has to cancel
the interaction of the drude charge with the partial charges of the cores
within the molecule. This can be done with special bonds that subtracts the P3M
short-range interaction of the charge portion `q_d q_{partial}`. This ensures
that only the *dipolar interaction* inside the molecule remains. It should be
considered that the error of this approximation increases with the share of the
long-range part of the electrostatic interaction. Two helper methods assist
with setting up this exclusion. If used, they have to be called
after all drude particles are added to the system::

    setup_intramol_exclusion_bonds(<system>, <molecule drude types>, <molecule core types>, <molecule core partial charges>, <verbose>)

This function creates the requires number of bonds which are later added to the
particles. It has to be called only once. In a molecule with `N` polarizable
sites, `N*(N-1)` bond types are needed to cover all the combinations.
Parameters are:

    * <system>: The espressomd.System().
    * <molecule drude types>: List of the drude types within the molecule.
    * <molecule core types>: List of the core types within the molecue that have partial charges.
    * <molecule core partial charges>: List of the partial charges on the cores.
    * <verbose>: (bool, optional) Prints out information about the created bonds (default: False)

After setting up the bonds, one has to add them to each molecule with the
following method::

    add_intramol_exclusion_bonds(<system>, <drude ids>, <core ids>, <verbose>)

This method has to be called for all molecules and needs the following parameters:

    * <system>: The espressomd.System().
    * <drude ids>: The ids of the drude particles within one molecule.
    * <core ids>: The ids of the core particles within one molecule.
    * <verbose>: (bool, optional) Prints out information about the added bonds (default: False)

Internally, this is done with the bond ``BondedCoulombP3MSRBond``, that
simply adds the p3m shortrange pair-force of scale `- q_d q_{partial}` the to
bonded particles.

.. seealso:: 

    Often used in conjunction with Drude oscillators is the :ref:`Thole correction`
    to damp dipole-dipole interactions on short distances. It is available in |es| 
    as a non-bonded interaction.
